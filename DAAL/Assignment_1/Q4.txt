1. Divide the file into smaller chunks. Since the file is 20GB, and your computer's RAM can only hold a few GB at most, you need to divide the file into smaller chunks that can fit into the RAM. For example, if your RAM is 8GB, you can divide the file into 2.5GB chunks.



2. Sort each chunk using a sorting algorithm. There are many sorting algorithms available, such as quicksort, merge sort, and heap sort. You can choose any sorting algorithm that you prefer.




3. Merge the sorted chunks. Once each chunk is sorted, you can merge them together to form a single sorted file. There are many ways to merge sorted chunks. One simple way is to use a linked list.
